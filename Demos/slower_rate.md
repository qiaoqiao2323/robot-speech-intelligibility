 our analysis utilized a data-driven methodology, focusing on the impact of varying speech rates on outcomes such as scores and user experience. By analyzing model predictions across a spectrum of speech rates and maintaining consistency in other variables through a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM), we pinpointed the range at which speech rate alterations significantly influence scores. We systematically evaluated the effect of speech rate changes on scores by generating predicted outcomes across a spectrum of speech rates, holding all other variables constant at their average or median values. This approach involved creating a new dataset featuring various combinations of predictors, with speech rate values spanning its observed spectrum while fixing other predictors at constant values. Our findings indicate a notable threshold within the 0.5 to 0.6 range, beyond which an increase in speech rate markedly reduces the predicted score. 

Thus, based on our analysis, we recommend setting the speech rate threshold around 0.5 to 0.6, to optimize scores and user experience.For a practical illustration of this recommendation, consider an example provided in a GitHub repository, where the implementation details and the analysis process are documented. But we have to note that these are the general analysis results based on our dataset, which might not be able to suit all the users.
