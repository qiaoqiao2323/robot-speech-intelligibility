the default voice wav file is under the `Demo/` named default_voice

We randomly picked 4 participants in the evaluation process, we recorded the robot's voice next to the speaker of the robot and without any ambient played.
The recording may not be really good as the limitation of the recording device.


the adaptive voice of participants 1 wav file is under the `Demo/` named P1
the adaptive voice of participants 2 wav file is under the `Demo/` named P2
the adaptive voice of participants 3 wav file is under the `Demo/` named P3
the adaptive voice of participants 4 wav file is under the `Demo/` named P4
